This app, inspired by RemindMeBot, allows you to set reminders in Modmail using a simple command. This can be useful in case you need to follow up on a modmail at a future date or time.

## Setting reminders

Use the command `RemindMe!`, `!remind` or `!remindme`, with the period specified e.g.

* `RemindMe! 1 day`
* `RemindMe! 2 weeks`
* `RemindMe! 6 months`

Intervals supported are `minute`, `day`, `week`, `month` and `year`.

If an existing reminder for the modmail thread already exists, it will be replaced with the new one.

## Cancelling reminders

Use the same command with "cancel" after e.g. `RemindMe! cancel`.
